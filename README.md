• Technology Stack
Our technology stack is centered around FullStack JavaScript, utilizing the following technologies:

Frontend: React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.(Redux toolkit for state management)
Backend: Node.js with Express for server-side logic and API development.
Database: PostgreSql for efficient and scalable data storage.(TypeOrm for connecting to backend)
Secure Cookies: We implement secure and HTTP-only cookies to prevent common security vulnerabilities. This ensures that cookies are only accessible through the HTTP protocol and not vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.
JWT: While cookies handle session management, we use JWT for transmitting authentication information securely between the client and server.
Real-Time Updates: Utilize Socket.io for real-time communication to provide instant updates.
Encryption (Cypher) for Data Security (Password reset and Verification after register process)
Nodemailer:Sending emails
Cloudinary, Multer:For image uploading and hosting
Bcrypt:Password hashing
